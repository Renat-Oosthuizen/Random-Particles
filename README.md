# Random-Particles

This is my own project that I did for fun and to learn more about real time applications. 

Note:Currently working on an improved version of this project that uses vector navigation, is configurable and supports multiple particle behaviours.

In this simulation particles can move in one of eight directions
Particles are only able to change direction within a 90 degree arc while moving (3 valid directions).
Particles choose out of the 3 valid directions randomly on each move. 
The 3 direction limit was implemented so that particles will make progress on the screen.

ESC key can be pressed to pause and resume simulation.
